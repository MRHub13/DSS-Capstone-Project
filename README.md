## Introduction

This is Capstone Project repository of Data Science Specialization series of courses organized by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.

### Course Dataset

The training data set listed below has been used as the basis for the most of the capstone.

### Milestone Report

Week 2 of the Data Science Capstone project covers *Exploratory Data Analysis* and *Modeling*. The goal has been to develop an understanding of the various 
statistical properties of the data set that can be later used when building the prediction model for the final data product.

At the end of week 2, students have been asked to create a Milestone Report that includes a description of the major features of the training data based on their exploratory data analysis and to summarize their plans for creating the text predictive model.

### Capstone Project Submission

The goal of this final project assignment is to implement a learning model for text prediction. Using the text prediction algorithm, create a product in Shiny
that provides a user interface that can be accessed by users.

This repository contains the `app.R` and `ngram.R` source code files for the developed Shiny application, `building_ngram_freq.R`code for buliding 'n-grams' (from unigrams to sextagrams) as well as the RStudio presentation files.

The Shiny application is hosted on shinyapps.io and the Presentation (slides) are available on RPubs.
